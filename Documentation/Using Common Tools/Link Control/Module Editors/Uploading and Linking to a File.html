        <h1>Uploading and Linking to a File</h1>
        <p>How to upload a file and then set a link to that file using the Link Control. </p>
        <p>
            Users must have permission to upload files to at least one folder of the Digital Asset Management (DAM) module that is located on the Admin &gt;&#160;File Management page. Users are granted permission to upload to their personal folder in the DAM module by default.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At <b>Link Type</b>, select <b>File ( A File On Your Site )</b>. Note: This field may not be displayed on some modules.</li>
            <li>At <b>File Location</b>, select a folder that you have access to upload files to. When you select a folder that you have access to upload files to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upload New File</span> link is displayed. This will populate the File Name field below with the file in this folder. Note: The My Folder folder is your own personal folder where you can manage your personal files such as your profile image.</li>
            <li>At <b>File Name</b>, click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upload New File</span> link. This displays the <b>Browse...</b> button.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Browse...</b> button.</li>
            <li>Locate and select the required file on your computer.</li>
            <li>Click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uploaded Selected File</span> link.</li>
