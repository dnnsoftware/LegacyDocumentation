        <h1>Creating a Custom Installation Setup</h1>
        <p>DNN allows you to modify what happens during the installation process by simply adding or removing files in the Install folder. During the installation process DNN reads the configuration file (DotNetNuke.install.config) and looks in the folders under Install to see if there are any new files that need to be processed during the installation. You can modify how DNN installs by editing the DotNetNuke.install.config file and by adding or removing files from these sub-folders.</p>
        <p class="note">Note: Zip files will automatically be installed and cannot be disabled when completing the Installation Wizard. Files with .resources extensions can be installed after the installation is complete. <MadCap:xref href="../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Extensions/About the Host Extensions Page.html">See "About the Host Extensions Page"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>A common change made to the DotNetNuke.install.config file is to force the password to be changed for the first super user created during an Auto Install.</p>
        <p>Here's how to include one of these add-ins to your DNN Custom Method installation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the DNN Installation zip file from the dnnsoftware.com web site.</li>
            <li>Unzip the installation file.</li>
            <li>In the unzipped installation file, go to the Install folder. This folder contains a number of sub-folders. Some of these folders contain aspects of DNN that can be modified during the installation process.</li>
            <li>Add one of the below zip/files to the correct sub-folder to make it available during installation:<ul><li><b>Authentication Systems</b>: Add authentication system zip files to the Install/AuthSystem folder. Note: If you wish to install the Active Directory authentication system you must set your site permissions to Full Trust.</li><li><b>Languages</b>: Add language resource package zip files to the Install/Languages folder.</li><li><b>Modules</b>: Add module installation zip files to the Install/Module folder. In this folder you can see there are some modules with a .resources extension and some with a .zip extension. The ones with a .zip extension are automatically installed and the ones with .resources are available in a check box list for you to decide during the install process if they get installed.</li><li><b>Providers</b>: Add provider zip files to the Install/Provider folder.</li><li><b>Skins</b>: Add skin package zip files to the Install/Skin folder.</li><li><b>Templates</b>: Add template package zip files to the Install/Templates folder.</li><li><b>Containers</b>: Add container package zip files to the Install/Container folder.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
