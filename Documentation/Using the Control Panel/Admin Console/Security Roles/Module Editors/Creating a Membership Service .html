        <h1>Creating a Membership Service</h1>
        <p>How to create a Membership Service using the Security Roles module. A Membership Service is a security role that is set as Public. These roles are displayed to users when they manage their account under the Manage Services link on the Manage Profile page. For here users can view details of the available membership services and elect to subscribe to or unsubscribe to them. A trial period, trial fee, service period, and service fee can also be set for membership services. <MadCap:xref href="Adding a Security Role with a Fee.html">See "Adding a Security Role with a Fee"</MadCap:xref></p>
