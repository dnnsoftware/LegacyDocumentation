        <h1>About Vendor Affiliate Accounts</h1>
        <p>One or more affiliate accounts can be created for Vendors in the Vendors module. These accounts are used for tracking advertising of this site on other websites. DNN generates the link for other websites to use, so that it can track each time a visitor clicks through to the site, from an advertising website, so that the difficulty in collecting information for commissions to be paid can be easily managed.</p>
