        <h1>Setting the Favicon</h1>
        <p>How to set the favicon  for your site. A favicon (short for favorites icon)  is an icon file, most commonly 16x16 pixels, associated with a particular website or web page.  A web designer can create such an icon and install it into a web site (or web page) by several means, and graphical web browsers will then make use of it. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page's favicon in the browser's address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically display the  favicon next to the page title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as desktop icon. The favicon is an important aspect of a site's brand identity and is an important attribute which needs to be customized for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p class="note">Note 1: If no favicon is set and there is a favicon.Ico file in the root of the site that favicon.Ico will be detected by browsers and used. DNN comes with a favorites icon (named "favicon.ico") that is located in the root folder of the site's Digital Asset Management module which is located on the Admin &gt;&#160;File Management page.</p>
        <p class="note">Note 2: Only files with an *.ico extension can be selected at this field, as these are the only files supported by Internet Explorer.</p>
