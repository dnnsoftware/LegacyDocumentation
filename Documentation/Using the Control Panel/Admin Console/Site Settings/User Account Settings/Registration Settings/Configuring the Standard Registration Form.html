        <h1>Configuring the Standard Registration Form</h1>
        <p>How to set the user registration options for this site. Settings include choosing the page users are redirected to after registration, optionally enabling the CAPTCHA security code feature and adding validation requirements.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/SiteSettings_16X16_Standard.png" />&#160;<strong> Site Settings</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>User Account Settings</strong> tab. </li>
            <li>Expand the <strong>Registration Settings</strong> section and then modify one or more settings. </li>
            <li>At <strong>User Registration</strong>, select either <strong>Private</strong>, <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Verified</strong> user registration. <MadCap:xref href="Enabling User Registration.html">See "Enabling User Registration"</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Disabling User Registration.html">See "Disabling User Registration"</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional.</strong> At <strong>Receive User Registration Notification</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to send a notification email to the user when they register. Note:&#160;A registration email will always be sent if the User Registration field above is set to Private because the Administrator will need to receive the notification to approve the user account. </li>
            <li><strong>Optional.</strong> At <strong>Use Authentication Providers</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to use Authentication providers during registration. Note: This setting may not be supported by all providers. </li>
            <li><strong>Optional.</strong> In the <strong>Excluded Terms</strong> text box, enter a comma-delimited list of terms that users will be prevented from using in their Username or Display Name. This is useful to prevent profanities or other unwanted words. Any excluded terms added here are in addition to
     those included with any profanity filters set.  
    </li>
            <li><strong>Optional.</strong> At <strong>Use Profanity Filter</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to enforce the profanity filter for both the Username and Display Name fields during registration.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>At <strong>Registration Form Type</strong>, select the <strong>Standard</strong> registration form. <ol><li><strong>Optional.</strong> At <strong>Use Email Address as Username</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to use the email address as a user name. This will remove the user name field from the registration form. </li><li>At <strong>Require Unique Display Name</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to set display names as unique. If a user chooses a name that exists already this will suggest a modified name based on the user's first name and last name - OR - <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Uncheck.flsnp" />.if more than one user can have the same display name. This option is unchecked by default.
    </li><li> In the <strong>Display Name Format </strong>text box, enter tokens to set the format of the users display name. Setting this option will prevent users from editing their display name. You can optionally specify a format for the users display name. The format can include tokens for dynamic substitution such as [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] and [USERNAME]. If a display name format is specified, the display name will no longer be editable through the user interface.</li><li>In the <strong>User Name Validation </strong>text box, modify the user name validation expression if required.
    E.g. [a-zA-Z0-9_]*$
    </li><li>In the <strong>Email Address Validation </strong>text box, modify the provided email validation expression. </li><li><strong>Optional.</strong> At <strong>Use Random Password</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to generate random passwords during registration, rather than displaying a password entry field. </li><li><strong> Optional. </strong>At <strong>Require Password Confirmation</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to require the registration form to display a password confirmation box. </li><li><strong>Optional.</strong> In the <strong>Password Expiry (in days)</strong> text box, enter the number of days until a user's password expires. Users will be prompted to change their password the next time they login. Enter 0 if the password never expires. Note: This field is only enforced if the user is using the regular DNN Authentication method. (I.e. They enter their User Name and Password when logging in). If the user logs in using alternate authentication methods such as Facebook, Live, Yahoo or Google, this setting will be ignored.</li><li>In the <strong>Password Expiry Reminder (in days)</strong> text box, enter the number of days warning given to a user notifying them that their password is about to expire and they are required to change it.</li><li>The following nine (9) read only settings are managed using the Configuration Manager. <MadCap:xref href="Viewing Preconfigured Registration Settings.html">See "Viewing Pre-Configured Registration Settings"</MadCap:xref></li><li>At <strong>Require a Valid Profile for Registration</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to require users to enter a valid profile during registration. Valid Profiles require the User Name, First Name, Last Names, Display Name, Email Address and Password fields to all be completed. In addition, any other fields that have been set as required in the Profile Setting section are required when registering on the site. <MadCap:xref href="../Profile Settings/Managing Profile Fields.html">See "Managing a Profile Field"</MadCap:xref> - OR - <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Uncheck.flsnp" />.to disable. This is the default setting.</li><li>At <strong>Use CAPTCHA For Registration</strong>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to use the CAPTCHA<br />    security code box during registration - OR -  <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Uncheck.flsnp" />.to remove CAPTCHA.</li><li>At <strong>Redirect After Registration</strong>, select the name of the page that users are redirected to after registering on the site - OR - Select <strong>&lt; None Specified &gt;</strong> to disable redirection.</li></ol></li>
