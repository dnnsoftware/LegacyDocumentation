        <h1>Setting the Home Page</h1>
        <p>How to set the Home page of this site. Visitors are taken to the Home page when they navigate to the URL of the site (E.g. <code>http://www.awesomecycles.biz</code> or <code> http://www.awesomecycles.biz/default.aspx</code>), unless a Splash page is displayed. Visitors are also taken to the Home page when they click on the site logo.</p>
        <p class="note">Note 1: On the default DNN site, a page called "Getting Started" has been set as the Home page.</p>
        <p class="note">Note 2: You cannot delete the page that has been set as the Home page. If you want to do so, you must first select an alternative home page.</p>
