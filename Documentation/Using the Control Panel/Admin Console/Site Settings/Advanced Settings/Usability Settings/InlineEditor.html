        <h1>About Inline Editing</h1>
        <p>The Inline Editing feature has been removed from DNN6+, however the field is still displayed in the  <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Usability Settings</strong> section of the Site Settings page. Enabling this feature here will not have any effect on site editing.</p>
