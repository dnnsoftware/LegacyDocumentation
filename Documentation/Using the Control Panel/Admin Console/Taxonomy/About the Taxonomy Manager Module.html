        <h1>About the Taxonomy Manager</h1>
        <p>The Taxonomy Manager module allows you to create and manage tags which are used to classify site content. Tags can be associated with pages (<MadCap:xref href="../../../Building Your Site/Adding and Managing Pages/Page Settings/Page Details Settings for Existing Pages.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.Admin Only,Default.Include Online">See "Page Details Settings for Existing Pages"</MadCap:xref>) and modules. Depending on the skin used on your site, users may be able associate content with existing tags created using the Taxonomy Manager module. They may also be able to create their own tags which can then be managed using the Taxonomy Manager module.</p>
        <p>
            Authenticated users who can view the module can see the list of existing vocabularies. Editors and Administrators can create and manage site specific vocabularies. 
        <span MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only">SuperUsers can create and manage application wide vocabularies that are available to all sites.</span></p>
        <p>The Taxonomy Manager is located on the Admin &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Tag_16X16_Standard.png" /> Taxonomy page and can also be added to site pages. </p>
