        <h1>Managing File Properties</h1>
        <p>How to modify the properties of files with Digital Asset Management including adding file tags, setting file attributes and setting publishing schedules. DNN&#160;Platform users (including anonymous users)&#160;must be granted Manage Settings permissions to the folder where the file is located.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Files_16x16_Standard.png" />&#160;<b>File Management</b> - OR - Go to a Digital Asset Management module.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the required folder. <MadCap:xref href="../All Users/Navigating to and Selecting Folders.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude DNNContent">See "Navigating to and Selecting Folders"</MadCap:xref></li>
            <li>Select the folder and click the <b>View Folder Properties</b> <![CDATA[ ]]><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/DAM/ViewProperties_16x16_ToolBar.png" /> button in the toolbar - OR - Right click on the folder and select <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/DAM/ViewProperties_16x16_ToolBar.png" /><b> View Folder Properties</b>.</li>
            <li>The following properties can be edited:<ol><li>In the  <b>Name</b> text box, enter a new file name. <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Warning.</span> Renaming a file does not update any references to this file across your site. E.g. If the file is an image that is displayed in the HTML module, renaming the file will break the path to the image  and you will need to manually update the image path by editing the content of that module. Because of this, it is recommended that you only rename a file when it is first uploaded to the site and has not yet to be used on the site.</li><li>In the <b>Tags</b> text box, enter one or more tags separated by a comma. </li><li>At <b>Attributes</b>, modify any of the following file attributes:<ul MadCap:continue="true"><li>At <b>Archive</b>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to allow the file to be archived by the operating system. This option is enabled by default.</li><li>At <b>Hidden</b>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to hide this file on the site. Hidden files don't display on your site in modules such as the HTML module, they are also not displayed on vendor banners, nor are they displayed for selection from the Rich Text Editor image or file galleries. This option is disabled by default.</li><li>At <b>Read-only</b>, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to set the file as read only. This option is disabled by default.</li><li>At <b>System</b>: <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />to disable hidden option in file properties (Windows). For fast searching, allow Indexing Service to index this file. This option is disabled by default.</li></ul></li></ol></li>
            <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button to save any modifications.</li>
