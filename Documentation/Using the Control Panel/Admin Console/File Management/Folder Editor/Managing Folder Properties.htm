            <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Files_16x16_Standard.png" />&#160;<b>File Management</b> - OR - Go to a Digital Asset Management<span MadCap:conditions="Default.DNN Content Only"> Pro</span> module.</li>

            <li>Select the folder and click the <b>View Folder Properties</b>&#160;<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/DAM/ViewProperties_16x16_ToolBar.png" /> button in the toolbar - OR - Right click on the folder and select <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/DAM/ViewProperties_16x16_ToolBar.png" /><b> View Folder Properties</b>.</li>

This field will be blank for folders that were generated when the site was built.</li><li><b>Created By</b>: First and last name of the user who created this folder.

            <li>The following properties can be edited:<ol><li>In the <b>Folder Name</b> text box, enter a new folder name. <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Warning.</span> Renaming a folder does not update any references to the files within the folder across your site. E.g. If a file within this folder is an image that is displayed in the HTML / HTML Pro module, then renaming the file will break the path to the image  and you will need to manually update the image by editing the content of that module. Because of this, it is recommended that you only rename folders before the file within them are used on the site.</li></ol><p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude DNNContent"><img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Admin/DAM/DAM_FolderProperties.png" /><br /><small>General Properties of a Digital Asset Management folder</small></p><ol MadCap:continue="true" MadCap:conditions="Default.DNN Content Only"><li>At <b>Versioning</b>, select from these options: <ol MadCap:continue="true"><li><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />at <b>Enable</b> to enable versioning for the files within this folder.
