        <h1>Navigating to Files</h1>
        <p>The Digital Asset Management<span MadCap:conditions="Default.DNN Content Only"> Pro</span> module displays the first ten (10) files within the selected folder inside the Files Window. When there are more than ten (10) files, the following options are displayed on the Files Navigation Bar located at the base of the module, allowing you to&#160;navigate to&#160;the additional files as well as change the default number of files displayed. All users can perform this task.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Items per Page</b>: Select the number of files (10, 25, 50, 100 or All) to be displayed in the Files Window. This setting will be retained when a new folder is selected, however it will default back to ten (10) files whenever the Digital Asset Management module is refreshed.</li>
            <li><b>Page Links</b>: When there is more than one page of files within the selected folder, a list of linked page numbers enables uses to navigate to other pages. E.g. </li>
            <li><b>Total Items</b>: The total number of items and whether the items are displayed on multiple pages. E.g. 48 items on 5 page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">Tip: When performing a task such as delete or copy against multiple files, you can select to view up to 100 file or All files on one page. This allows you to perform the task on all those files at one time.</p>
