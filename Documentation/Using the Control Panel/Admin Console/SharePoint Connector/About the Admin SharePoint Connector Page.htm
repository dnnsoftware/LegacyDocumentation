        <h1>About the SharePoint Connector</h1>
        <p>DNN&#160;Enterprise is for organizations with a sophisticated IT infrastructure and multiple content contributors that deploy DNN in critical web applications. The Microsoft SharePoint Connector enables organizations to leverage the power of the SharePoint Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution and the flexibility of the DNN Web Content Management System (CMS). Organizations can securely, cost effectively publish documents stored in their SharePoint document repository to a public web site, extranet or intranet powered by DNN. The connector ensures that only the current version of documents is exposed, ensuring adherence to governance rules and best business practices.</p>
        <p>The SharePoint Connector module enables SuperUsers and Administrators to synchronize files between a SharePoint site and a DNN site. Files that are maintained on SharePoint are the 'master' files that are then 'pushed' to your DNN site. </p>
