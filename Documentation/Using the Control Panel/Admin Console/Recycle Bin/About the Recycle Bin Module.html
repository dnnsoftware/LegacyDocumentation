        <h1>About the Recycle Bin</h1>
        <p>The Recycle Bin stores details of all pages and modules that have been deleted from a site. These pages and modules can be restored to the site or permanently removed. The Recycle Bin module is located on the Admin &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Trash_16x16_Standard.png" /><strong> Recycle Bin</strong> page and can be added to any site page.</p>
        <p>Unauthenticated users who can view the page where the Recycle Bin module is located can view details of all pages and modules within in the Recycle Bin, however, they cannot perform any tasks. Users require Edit Module (Edit Content) permissions to manage perform tasks.</p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Restoring a page will restore it to its previous location on the site menu, but all modules (including content) will not be restored, unless user restores them separately
    </li>
            <li value="2">A module (including content) is restored to a selected page</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Deleting Modules and Pages</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Deletion is permanent</li>
            <li value="2">Page deletion includes modules and content </li>
            <li value="3">Module deletion includes content</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">Tip: It is recommended that unwanted pages and module are regularly deleted from the recycle bin. This will ensures that the Recycle Bin doesn't become so large that Site Administrators must search through a large number of modules and pages to find the required item.</p>
