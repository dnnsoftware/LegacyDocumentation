        <h1>Sending Newsletters in a User's Preferred Language</h1>
        <p>How to send a newsletter to user's in their preferred language using the Newsletter module. Multiple languages must be installed and enabled on this site to display the Language Filter field. </p>
        <p><b class="Important">Important. </b>When you select a Language Filter, only users associated with that language will receive a newsletter. E.g. If you select English (United States) as the language filter, then only users who have selected English (United States) as their Preferred Locale in their profile will receive the newsletter. Users who have selected English (Australia) will not receive a newsletter. If a user has not set a preferred language, they will only receive newsletters sent to the default site language.</p>
