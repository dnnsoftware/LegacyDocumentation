        <h1>About Newsletters</h1>
        <p>Newsletters allows individual or bulk email messages (newsletters) to be sent to the members of one or more security roles and/or to one or more email addresses. Messages are sent to each recipient separately to prevent recipients from seeing each other's details. Newsletters identifies when a newsletter is set to send to an email address more than once and ensures only one copy of the newsletter is sent to that address. The message can be either plain text or HTML format. Files can be attached  and replacement tokens can be included. Once a newsletter is sent, the sender receives the "Bulk Email Report for [Newsletter Subject]" message. <MadCap:xref href="The Bulk Email Report.html">See "The Bulk Email Report"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Newsletters is pre-installed on the Admin &gt;Newsletters page and can also be deployed to sites and added to pages.</p>
        <p>
            All users who are authorized to view Newsletters can send emails. Authenticated users must to have permissions granted to one or more folders of the site's Digital Asset Management module (Admin&#160;&gt;&#160;File Management) to upload and/or select files. Unauthenticated users cannot attach files to messages. <MadCap:xref href="../File Management/Folder Editor/Modifying Folder Permissions.html">See "Modifying Folder Permissions"</MadCap:xref></p>
