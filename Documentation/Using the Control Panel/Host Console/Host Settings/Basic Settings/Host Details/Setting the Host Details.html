        <h1>Setting the Host Details</h1>
        <p>How to set the title, URL and email address for the host site. The host title is displayed wherever the [HOSTNAME] skin token is included in the skin design. If the host URL field is also completed, the title functions as a link to the URL. </p>
        <p>Note. A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Help</span> link is displayed on pages where the [HELP] token is included in the skin design. When an authenticated user clicks the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Help</span> link this opens their email program enabling them to send an email message to the Primary Administrator. When an Administrator clicks the link they are able to send an email to the host email address. In both cases the message subject is always: [Portal Name] Support Request.</p>
