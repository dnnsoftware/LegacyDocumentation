        <h1>Setting Child Site Hosting Fee</h1>
        <p>How set the default hosting fee for child sites in this DNN installation. The cost of hosting is set as a fee for Megabyte space, page quota or user quota. For example, if hosting is allocated by Megabytes the available hosting space is checked whenever a file is uploaded to the site's Digital Asset Management module which is located on the Admin &gt;&#160;File Management page. If sufficient space is available, the files are successfully loaded. If there is insufficient space, the Administrator receives a message to contact their hosting provider to purchase additional space. Likewise, the same message is displayed when the Administrator attempts to add more pages or user accounts than allocated. Where more than one option is set, hosting is restricted when the first option reached. Note: Host settings can be modified for individual sites via the Host &gt; Site Management page.
