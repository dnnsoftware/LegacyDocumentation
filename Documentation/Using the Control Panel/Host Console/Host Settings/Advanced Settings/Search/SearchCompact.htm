        <h1>Compacting the Search Index</h1>
        <p>SuperUsers can compact the data in the search index to reclaim space that is allocated to deleted data. During crawling DNN not only adds new documents, but it also deletes older documents. This is especially true for URL Crawlers, which result in lots of deletes. The deleted documents aren't removed immediately; instead they are flagged as deleted and are excluded in future searches. Compacting is needed to reclaim space from deleted content.</p>
        <p><b>Important.</b> Compacting is recommended only when there are many 'Deleted Documents' in Index Store. Compacting may require twice the size of current Index Store during processing. Both Compacting and Re-Indexing are done by scheduled job. </p>
