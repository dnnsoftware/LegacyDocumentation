        <h1>Setting Page State Persistence</h1>
        <p>How to set the page state persistence setting which directs DNN on where to store the ViewState for the page. Page State Persistence can be stored in either the rendered output of the page by choosing Page or stored in the memory of the server by choosing Memory. The default setting is Page which will add a long string to the HTML of the Page. You can see this by right clicking the page and selecting View Source. It is located at the bottom of the page. If Page is selected the view setting looks like this:</p>
        <p><code>input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" id="__VIEWSTATE" value="/wEPDwUKLTIyODM3NTczMw9kFgZmDxYCHgRUZXh0BT48IURPQ1</code>
        </p>
        <p>Choosing Memory will cause DotNetNuke to store the ViewState information in the memory on the server. This setting reduces the HTML payload to the Web browser by around 15% but it also increases the amount of memory used on the server. The server has a setting on it that causes it to dump its memory if it reaches 80% of the available memory and this will slow down your web site so be careful when choosing this option. Only use it on small sites that have to run very fast. The ViewState will then look like this:</p>
        <p><code>input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" id="__VIEWSTATE" value="/</code>
        </p>
