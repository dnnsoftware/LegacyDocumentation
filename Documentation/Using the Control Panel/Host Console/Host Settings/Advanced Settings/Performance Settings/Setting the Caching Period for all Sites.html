        <h1>Setting the Caching Period for all Sites</h1>
        <p>To assist in handling of different website styles, DotNetNuke is capable of having its performance tuned to maximize database and server interaction. It does this in the form of caching, which allows content which has already been generated from the database to be stored as a file for the next time the same information is required. DotNetNuke has quite a few sets of information that get used every time a page is clicked. These pieces of information are cached on the server so that the pages are shown as fast as possible. The Performance Setting changes how long this information is cached. The information includes items like the list of Pages, the permissions on those pages, the list of modules in use on the site anpermissions for folders in the Digital Asset Management module.</p>

DNN will retrieve information from the database and store it in a cache for a short period of time. Best for websites updated on a frequent basis.</li><li><b>Moderate</b>: Select for a caching period of 1 minute.  DNN will retrieve information from the database and store it in a cache for a period of time. Best for most websites containing information updated on a regular basis. This is the default option.</li><li><b>Heavy</b>: Select for a caching period of 2 minutes. DNN will retrieve information from the database and store it in a cache for an extended period of time.
