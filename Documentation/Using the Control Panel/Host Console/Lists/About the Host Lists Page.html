        <h1>About the Host Lists Page</h1>
        <p>The Host &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Lists_16X16_Standard.png" /> Lists page displays the Lists module which enables SuperUsers to maintain lists of information which can be identified by a key value and a data value.
Examples of when a list may be created would be to create a new regions list for a country on the existing Country list, or to create a new list to manage categories on the Documents module.
</p>
        <p>The Lists module is based around Lists and Entries, which are in effect the same, but their usage defines their differences:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A List is a collection of Entries, which has a Key Identifier and a Data Portion.
    </li>
            <li value="2">An Entry is an individual item of data which relates to a List and is made up of a Key Identifier and a Data Portion.  An example of this is the countries list used in DNN. The list is 'Countries' and the entries are the actual countries. E.g. Australia, England, Holland
    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Each Entry can also be a list. An example of this is the regions list used in DNN. In this case the Country, which is an entry under the Countries List, can be its own list and have region entries associated with it.</p>
