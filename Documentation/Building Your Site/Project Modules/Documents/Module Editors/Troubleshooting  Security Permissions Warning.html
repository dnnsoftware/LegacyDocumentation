        <h1>Troubleshooting: Security Permissions Warning</h1>
        <p>The following security permissions warning may be displayed when you attempt to add or edit a document using the Documents module: <br />"Warning: The security permissions for the selected file do not match this module's configured view roles. The module is configured to allow viewing by role 'All Users', but the file does not. For users who are not members of a role that can view the file, this document row will not be displayed. You can adjust security settings using the File Manager in the admin menu."</p>

        </p>
        <p>Here are the options to fix this problem:</p>
        <p><b>Option One: Using the Selected File</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can choose to use the file you have already selected, however the document will only be displayed to users with the correct permissions to browse or view the file.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are editing a document, click the <b>Update</b> button. This link isn't displayed when adding a document.</li>
            <li>Click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update Anyway</span> link.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img alt="" style="visibility: visible; mso-wrap-style: square;" src="../../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Document/Documents_TS_SecurityPermissions2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Note 1: The warning message continues to display on the Edit Documents page.</p>
        <p>Note 2: You will no longer need to confirm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update Anyway</span> for this document.</p>
        <p><b>Option Two: Modifying the File Location</b>
        </p>
        <p>How to allow all roles authorized to view the module to access the document. This topic  assumes you are currently located on the Edit Documents page and are adding or editing the required document. </p>
