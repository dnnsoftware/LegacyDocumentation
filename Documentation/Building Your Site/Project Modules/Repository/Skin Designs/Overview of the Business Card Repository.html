        <h1>Overview of the Business Card Repository</h1>
        <p>By applying the Business Card skin, the Repository module can be used to display a list of company details in a business card layout.&#160;Each business card displays the company name, company address (this field uses the Rich Text Editor so other details such as email addresses, phone numbers, can be entered), the company tagline, and the date when the card was last updated. A company logo can optionally be displayed. There are no downloads associated with this skin.</p>
        <p>Categories and&#160;sorting are enabled on this skin.</p>
