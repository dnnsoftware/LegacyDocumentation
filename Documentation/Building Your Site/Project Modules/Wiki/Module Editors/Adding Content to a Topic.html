        <h1>Adding Content to a Topic</h1>
        <p>How to add content to a topic which has been created as a link on another Wiki page but has not yet had content created. These topics don't have an associated Wiki Page, and are therefore not displayed in the Show All Pages list.</p>
        <p><b>Option One</b>:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li value="1">Navigate to the page which has a link to the topic. See <MadCap:xref href="../All Users/Navigating the Wiki.html">See "Navigating the Wiki"</MadCap:xref></li>
            <li value="2">Click on the [Topic Name] link.</li>
            <li value="3">Complete Steps 2 onwards in <MadCap:xref href="Adding a Wiki Page.html"> "Adding a Wiki Page"</MadCap:xref></li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Option Two</b>:</p>
        <p>You can also simply add a Wiki page (See "Adding a Wiki Page"), however you need to ensure the spelling of the Page Name is exactly the same as linked Topic Name.</p>
