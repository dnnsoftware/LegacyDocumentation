        <h1>Important Information About Roles</h1>
        <p>The Store Admin module can be configured to enable a single role to Manage Orders ( update order status and send messages to the customer&#160;) and another ( or the same ) role to Manage Catalog (create and manage categories and products and well as manage reviews). In this way, the Store Admin module can handle all store administrative tasks from one place and provide different levels of access to different users.</p>
        <p>Details on granting page and module permissions for the Store Admin module is covered in this tutorial.</p>
        <p>To set this up now, you should create the role you want to manage orders and the one you want to manage the catalog before beginning this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can set up these permissions at a later time. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Using the Control Panel/Admin Console/Security Roles/Module Editors/Adding a Security Role - Basic Settings.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.Include Online,Default.Exclude Project Modules"> "Adding a Security Role (Basic Settings)"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>For the purpose of this manual, the following names are used when referring to these user groups:</p>
        <p><b>Customers</b>:&#160;Users and roles that have been View Module permissions to the Store page.</p>
        <p><b>Catalog Managers</b>: Member of the role that has been selected at the "Manage Catalog" field on the Store Info page of the Store Admin module.
