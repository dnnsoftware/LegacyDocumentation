        <h1>Working with Product Images</h1>
        <p><b>Image Formats and Locations</b>
        </p>
        <p>Five standard bitmap file formats can be used for products images (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIF). They can be stored anywhere in the portal subfolder (E.g.: ...\Portals\n\). </p>
        <p>The PNG transparency is fully supported (PNG-8 and PNG-24). We recommend using PNG-8 for wider compatibility, included Internet Explorer 6. Because the .NET Framework does not natively support the GIF transparency, therefore you have to define the "GIF Background" setting if you want to use GIF images with transparency.</p>
        <p>You might want to facilitate their management by grouping them into sub-folders by category, and use the product model number as a basis for their file name. You can also use external image files, but the DNN instance may require the full trust level. <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Configuration Manager/Enabling Full Trust for DotNetNuke Sites.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.Include Online,Default.SuperUser Only">See "Enabling Full Trust for DotNetNuke Sites"</MadCap:xref>. Visit the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" alt="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft MSDN website</a> for more information about trust levels. For security reasons, some hosting plans do not allow to operate in this mode.

        <p><b>Thumbnail Settings</b>
        </p>
        <p>Three settings control the thumbnail display for each product section. The Show Thumbnails setting allows you to turn on/off the thumbnail display without changing the associated template. Thumbnails are created dynamically based on the size specified in the Thumbnail Width setting. Although source images can theoretically be of any size, it is better to reduce their width to the maximum size specified in the Thumbnail Width setting. To do this, you can use any photo editing tool or website. This can reduce the image processing time and therefore alleviate the server workload. Similarly, the weight of the pictures should also be optimized. Depending on the quality of the source, you can reduce several MB to a few KB, save bandwidth, time and disk space. By default, all generated thumbnails are cached during 2 minutes. They are two settings in the Store Catalog general settings used to enable or disable the cache and the duration. If you use GIF images with transparency, set the 'GIF Background' setting with the hex value of the background color of your template. The default background color is white (FFF).

        <p><b>Image Caching</b>
        </p>
        <p>Image caching can be enabled on your store. It is recommended that you disable this feature  while designing the Store or you will have to wait for the cache duration to see your image changes (impacted settings are size and background color for GIF images). <MadCap:xref href="../Settings/Catalog Settings/01 General Settings.html">See "Managing Store Catalog General Settings"</MadCap:xref></p>
