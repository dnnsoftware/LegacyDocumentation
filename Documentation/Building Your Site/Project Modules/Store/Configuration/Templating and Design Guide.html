        <h1>Templating and Design Guide</h1>
        
        
        
        <p>The Store module can easily be personalized. The template system builds pages dynamically, with HTML templates containing tokens, and several cascading styles sheets. The default templates and style sheets are XHTML compliant. They have been tested with Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.
</p>
        <p>In brief, the chosen content, which is read from the database, is displayed using templates, while its presentation (type, colors and sizes) is defined in the style sheets.
</p>
        <p>A template is a file containing static HTML code, and dynamic tokens, which retrieve certain content from the database: for example, the products description or properties.
</p>
        <p>The elegance of the Store module's architecture is that templates can be embedded. This makes the design very flexible. You may for example design the products’ presentation once for all catalogs (main, new products, featured, etc.); but alternatively you may design a different layout for every catalog. This helps building your own library of reusable catalog templates, which you can use in other sites like a construction game.
Skin objects are small pieces of ready-to-use code that can easily be placed inside a skin by a designer without programming knowledge.<span style="color: #b22222;"> </span></p>
        <p>All labels and messages comply with the DNN localization standards. This provides translation capabilities to other languages. But it may also be used to change the texts and build your own ‘pack’, adjusting your text to the site's audience.</p>
