        <h1>Changing the Event View</h1>
        <p>The Events module allows you to view events in either a monthly calendar, a weekly list or as a list. All three view options are available in the default configuration, however one or more views can be disabled and the design and fields displayed in each view can also be modified. In the below images, the default configurations are used.</p>
        <p><b>Important.</b> If the Icon Bar has been disabled, unauthenticated users will be unable to change the view because access to the module actions menu is restricted to authenticated users only.</p>
        <p>Here are the three different views that can be selected using either the module actions menu or the Event module Icon Bar:</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" src="../../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Events/icons/cal-list.gif" /><strong> List View</strong>: Displays events in a list.
  </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" src="../../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Events/icons/cal-month.gif" /><strong> Month View</strong>: Displays events in a monthly calendar. By default the current date is highlighted. Links to the previous month and the next month enable you view other months.</p>

        <p>
            <img alt="" src="../../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Events/icons/cal-week.gif" /><strong> Week View</strong>: Displays events for the current week. Click the double arrow links ( <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b> &gt;&gt;</b> ) located to scroll back and forward one week at a time.</p>
