        <h1>Adding a Social Group Journal Entry</h1>
        <p>How to post an entry to the Journal associated with a Social Group. The entry will appear in both your profile and on the Social Groups module. Depending on the Journal settings, you may be able to attach a photo or a file to each post. You cannot add more than one attachment (either a photo or a file) to a post. Photo attachments display below the post and are scaled up or down to be as a standard width of 250 pixels. File attachments display as a File <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/File_16x16_Standard.png" /> icon above the linked file name. Note: For information on managing Journal posts, <MadCap:xref href="../Journal/About the Journal Module.html">See "About the Journal Module"</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the Social Groups module.</li>
            <li>Click on the name of the required group.</li>
            <li>In the "Tell the world something..." message box, paste or type your message. A maximum length is set for each message so if you paste in a message longer than the allowed message length, then the additional characters will be trimmed from the end of the message. Likewise, if you attempt to type in a longer message than is permitted you will be prevented from entering any additional characters once the maximum is reached. Note: You can cancel the new entry by clicking the <strong>Cancel</strong>&#160;<img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Journal/ico_Cancel.png" />&#160;button that is displayed in the top right corner of the module once you commence entering the message.</li>
