        <h1>About the Console</h1>
        <p>The Console displays a list of links to the child pages below any parent pages. The Console is added to both the Admin Console and Host Console pages by default and can also be deployed to a site and added to any page. The Console can be configured to display links in a variety of layouts and to display more or less information about the pages that are listed.</p>
