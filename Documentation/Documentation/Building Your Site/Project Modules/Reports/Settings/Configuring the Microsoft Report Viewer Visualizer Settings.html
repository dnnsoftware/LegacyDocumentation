        <h1>Configuring the Microsoft Report Viewer Visualizer Settings</h1>
        <p>The Microsoft ReportViewer Visualizer uses the ReportViewer control to display rich reports, as well as reports running on a SQL Server Reporting Services instance. Note: The&#160;Microsoft Report Viewer Visualizer is not included with the Report module; however it can be installed and configured by your Host.</p>
        <p><b class="Important">Important.</b> This Visualizer DOES NOT require a license to Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services. All you need is this module and DNN.</p>
        <p>The ReportViewer Visualizer has two modes: Local Report Mode and Server Report Mode.</p>
        <p><b>About Local Report Mode</b>: In Local Report Mode, the Report is run by the Reports Module on your web server. Using the Report Designer Add-In for Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express (both of which are free downloads) or Visual Studio 2005 or 2008, you can design a report and save it as an RDLC file. After creating an RDLC file for your report, upload it to your site and select that file from the ReportsViewer Visualizer settings page. Then, enter the name of the DataSource used in the RDLC report into the Data Source Name field. The Reports Module will provide the data from the Data Source to the RDLC report through this Data Source.</p>
        <p><b>About Server Report Mode</b>: In Server Report Mode, the Report is run by an instance of Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). In order to use this mode, you will need an instance of SSRS and must know the user name and password of an account with permission to access the server. Specify the URL of the server and the path, within the server, to the Report you wish to display. If authentication is required, specify the User Name, Password, and Domain of a user account with permission to access the server.</p>
