        <h1>Managing Reports Module Add-Ins </h1>
        <p>The Reports Module can be extended in two ways by installing custom add-ins. Custom Data Sources allow users to build reports to extract data from any kind of tabular data source. Custom visualizers allow users to display report data in any way they need. To manage the add-ins installed in your system, go to the Module Actions Menu and select Manage Add-Ins. On this page, you will see a grid of installed Add-Ins. Some of these add-ins are marked as Built-In Components using the Manage Packages <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Modules/Report/ManagePackages.gif"  /> button. These Add-Ins are displayed for informational purposes only and cannot be removed.</p>
        <p>New Add-Ins can be installed using the Install Visualizer and Install DataSource commands at the bottom of the page. After clicking one of these links, you can select a ZIP file containing a Reports Add-In package and install it into the system. </p>
        <p>Custom Add-Ins installed using these commands can be uninstalled by clicking the Delete icon (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/delete.gif"  />) in the left-most column of the grid. You will be asked to confirm the uninstallation before it occurs.</p>
        <p>A number of additional Add-Ins are included with the Reports Module package, but are not installed by default due to external dependencies. If you wish to use these Add-Ins, this section details how to install the required components and the Add-Ins themselves.</p>
