        <h1>Installing the Chart Visualizer</h1>
        <p>The Chart Visualizer displays a simple horizontal bar or vertical column chart from the data retrieved by your query. The Chart Visualizer 

is not included with the Report module, however it can be installed and downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zedgraph/files/zedgraph dll only/5.1.1 + 4.6.1/" target="_blank"><span class="Hyperlink">SourceForge</span></a>. In its current version, the Chart Visualizer is limited to displaying this form of Bar Chart. It is limited to displaying the value of one column as the height of the bar. Note: The Chart Visualizer requires that your site is running in a Fully Trusted environment.  If you are in a shared hosting environment, you may need to contact your hosting provider to have your site moved to a Full Trust environment. <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Configuration Manager/Enabling Full Trust for DotNetNuke Sites.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude Project Modules,Default.Include Online">See "Enabling Full Trust for DNN Sites"</MadCap:xref></p>
