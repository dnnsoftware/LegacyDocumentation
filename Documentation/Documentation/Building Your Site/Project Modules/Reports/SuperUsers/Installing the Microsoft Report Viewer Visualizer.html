        <h1>Installing the Microsoft Report Viewer Visualizer</h1>
        <p>The Microsoft ReportViewer Visualizer uses the ReportViewer control to display rich reports, as well as reports running on a SQL Server Reporting Services instance. This visualizer displays reports produced in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/reporting/rdlspec.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Report Definition Language</a>. This includes reports that are processed locally on the web server as well as reports processed on a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/reporting/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services </a>server. The ReportViewer Visualizer has two modes: Local Report Mode and Server Report Mode. <MadCap:xref href="../Settings/Configuring the Microsoft Report Viewer Visualizer Settings.html">See "Configuring the Microsoft Report Viewer Visualizer Settings"</MadCap:xref> for details on using this visualizer. </p>
