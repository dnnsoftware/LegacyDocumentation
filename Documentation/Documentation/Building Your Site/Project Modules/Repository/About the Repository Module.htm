        <h1>About the Repository Module</h1>
        <p>The Repository module stores and displays a range of items. The type of items stored is controlled through the skin which is applied to the module. By changing the skin applied to the module, the Repository can be used for numerous purposes such as a simple blog, a media repository, a file repository, an articles repository, a compact file listing, and more. The Repository module offers fine grained permissions which allows you to control which roles can download, upload, rate and comment on items. Features such as moderation and personal are also included.</p>
        <p><b>Installation Note</b>: This module must be deployed and installed on your site by a SuperUser. <MadCap:xref href="../../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Extensions/Deploying and Installing More Extensions.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only,Default.Include Online">See "Deploying and Installing More Extensions"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p><b class="Important">Important Upgrade Note.</b> If you have modified any of the standard templates that are part of the Repository package, be sure to back them up before installing this new release, then restore them after the release has been installed. Alternatively, you can copy them to the /Portals/n/RepositoryTemplates folder which is the preferred location for storing modified templates.</p>
