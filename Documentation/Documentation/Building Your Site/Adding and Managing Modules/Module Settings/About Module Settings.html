        <h1>About Module Settings</h1>
        <p>All modules include a Module Settings page that enables authorized users to modify basic settings related to the module content (e.g. module title, module header and footer, module start and end dates) and module permissions (e.g. which roles or users are able to view and manage the module).  This page also controls more advanced settings related to the design of the module (containers, borders, printing) and site wide module settings.</p>
        <p>All modules have a Settings page that can be accessed by selecting <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Modules/About/ico_manage.png" /> <![CDATA[ ]]><b>Manage</b> &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/action_settings.gif" /><b> Settings</b> from the module actions menu.  The Module Settings page enables authorized users to modify basic module settings related to the module content (e.g. module title, module header and footer, module start and end dates) and module permissions (e.g. which roles are able to view and edit a module).  This page also controls more advanced settings related to the design of the module (containers, borders, printing) and site wide module settings.</p>
        <p>The page is divided into these tabs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Module Settings</b>: Settings relating to the Module content.  Module Settings are settings which are the same on all pages where the Module appears. This section is divided into Basic Settings, Advanced Settings and Added to Pages. </li>
            <li value="2"><b>Permissions</b>: This section includes module permissions where access to view, edit and manage the module is set. Note:  Some modules  have additional permissions to add/edit and manage module content.
    </li>
            <li value="3"><b>Page Settings</b>: Settings specific to this particular occurrence of the module for this page.
    This section is divided into Basic Settings and Advanced Settings.</li>
