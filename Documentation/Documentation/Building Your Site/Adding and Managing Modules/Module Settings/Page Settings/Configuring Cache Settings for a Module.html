        <h1>Configuring Cache Settings for a Module</h1>
        <p>How to set the provider used for cached files and set the period before the cache in DNN refreshes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Module Settings.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>Select the <b>Page Settings</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Go to the <b>Cache Settings</b> section.</li>
            <li>At <b>Output Cache  Provider</b>, select  the provider to use for this page from these options:
    <ul><li><b>None Specified</b>: Select to disable caching. It this option is selected, skip to Step 6.</li><li><strong>File</strong>: Choose this option to save cached items to a file system. This option is suitable for a shared hosting environment. This is the default setting. </li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: This is the fastest caching method. Select this option if you have web site has a large amount of RAM allocated. This is typically not suitable for a shared hosting environment.</li></ul></li>
            <li>In the <b>Cache Duration (Seconds)</b> text box, enter the duration (in  seconds) the information for this page will be refreshed. The default setting is 1200. I.e. Entering 60 will mean that every 60 seconds DNN will refresh module content from the database. Set to a low number like 0 if your module content changes frequently or set it to a higher number like 1200 if the content doesn't change all that often and you would like better performance out of your site.</li>
        </ol>
