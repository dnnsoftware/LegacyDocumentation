        <h1>About the Mobile Skin</h1>
        <p>A mobile site skin package called DotNetNuke.DarkKnightMobile is included with DNN. These skins are suitable for use for a mobile website.  This skin package includes skin objects appropriate for an independent mobile website and skin objects that are appropriate for a mobile microsite.</p>
        <p><b>Mobile Friendly Menu</b>
        </p>
        <p>The mobile friendly skin will present the website menu in two different styles in order to maximize the viewing experience on mobile devices.</p>
        <p><b>Landscape Mode</b>
        </p>
        <p>For devices with a wide aspect ratio, the menu will show across the top of the page with the direct children pages showing as links above the main menu.</p>
        <p>

        <p><b>Portrait Mode</b>
        </p>
        <p>For devices with narrower aspect ratio, the menu will initially be hidden with a  button which will expand to show the top level pages.  Direct child pages will be shown in a stacked styled-menu at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <p><b>Mobile Website</b>
        </p>
        <p>The mobile skin package will contain two types of mobile friendly skins, one for use with standalone mobile websites and one for use with microsites.  The only difference between the two types of skins is what shows in the menu.</p>
