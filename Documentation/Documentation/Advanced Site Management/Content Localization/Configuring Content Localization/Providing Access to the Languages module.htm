        <h1>Providing Access to the Languages module</h1>
        <p>The Languages module should be added to a site page to allow non-Administrator translators to manage translations via the Content Localization tab. Once the module has been added to the site as detailed below, then all users associated with a translator role will be able to view and manage the status of translations for their language.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Create a new site page and grant View Page permissions to each of the translator roles and any additional usernames as required.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Add a Languages module to the page. In the below image, the user who is viewing the module is only a member of the "Translator (de-DE)"&#160;role, therefore they can only see and manage the German language translations.</li>
